		<p>I like the idea of the visual evil being kind of creepy, but this might be too over the top obvious. I like the direction but it might need to be more subtle. This isn&#8217;t its true form, but a hidden, papered over version to make it more appealing.</p>

		<p>But similar to how seeing the evil for what it is reveals the truth, the true uncloaked evil is horrifyingly disturbing. </p>

		<p>One arm is sheered, or carved, into a splintered point, with sinew and nerves still hanging against bone. Its bodily form is swollen to overflowing with wriggling, squamous worms. Perhaps it <em>is</em> the wormsâ€”a collected consciousness. Its platitude of &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; is a consciousness born a thousand minds. The worms have a three-segmented mouth that constantly snap closed. </p>

		<p>The one that speaks for the evil. It has no face. Under the strange helm (crafted in the fashion of the worms) is a belching cloud of smoke that trails after it. It only has long arms, burned and blistered and wrapped in bandages. It has no legs, it&#8217;s tattered cloak hovering just above the ground.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about these guys, I don&#8217;t really like the look right now, and I don&#8217;t really know if they&#8217;re needed. Maybe some things, small and cruel and fierce to keep the puppets in line. </p>
