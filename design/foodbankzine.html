				<h2>Food Bank Zine</h2>
				<h3>Book Design</h3>
				<p>Plant a Row encourages farmers and gardeners to plant an extra row in their gardens and donate the food to the <a href="http://www.fbd.org/">Food Bank of Delaware</a> (the client). The brief was focused toward a garden center audience. I decided a good solution for this audience would be a small book, or zine, they could pick up and check out. Since the Food Bank is a non-profit and doesn’t have much money to get the word out about what they do, I decided that the zine should be very graphic and purely black and white. This way, they could easily reproduce it with a photocopier.</p>
				<!-- <p>I began to write and sketch ideas for the zine, collecting the info I knew about the Food Bank. This led me to creating covers that would grab attention in garden centers. Because it was black and white I knew it would stand out, but I wanted text and imagery that would make people curious, and hopefully take it with them. I also decided that the size of the zine should be fairly easy to reproduce, so I began to design a book that could be created by folding a 8.5”x11” paper in half. This would make it easily reproducible, as well as photocopyable.</p> -->
			<p>	I eventually settled on the idea of “how to grow outstanding vegetables,” but I was sure to make note on the cover that it wasn’t just about growing. It was about donating too. The zine has few pages explaining what Plant a Row is with the rest is about how to grow great plants. I decided to make half the pages about the plants and half about the Food Bank of Delaware.</p>
				<p>Because the zine was meant to be very graphic, I used Illustrator to make some very contrasted illustrations out of my initial sketches. <a href="http://katyorr.com/">Katy Orr</a> created the illustrations for the plant pages (pages 4, 5, and 6). Using copy from the Food Bank website, I wrote my own. I found gardening tips for vegetables and herbs online as well.</p>
