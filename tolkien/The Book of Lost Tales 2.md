## What to Expect
**You do not need to read Book of Lost Tales 1 to read Book of Lost Tales 2.**

I thought it may be helpful to jot down a few notes for people who may never have read any of the _History of Middle-Earth_ series. These notes are specific to these two first volumes, _The Book of Lost Tales, Volume 1_ and _Volume 2_. 

1. **Read _The Silmarillion_ twice.** Seriously. You'll get a lot more out of this book if you know your Manwës from your Melkors. 
2. **This is not a narrative.** It is a history of Tolkien's progress in writing fairy stories that eventually became his published works. His son Christopher approaches this in a detached, scholarly manner. 
3. **This is a narrative.** Christopher interrupts quite frequently but also does a wonderful job at keeping the throughline of the story's frame narrative. 
4. The story has **a frame narrative totally unfamiliar to readers of _The Silmarillion_.** A man, Eriol or Ælfwine (the name changes), lands on the island of Tol Eressëa, discovers the elves, and learns their history. 
5. **The characters of this book often share names with characters in _The Silmarillion_ but they are _not_ the same character.** Sometimes they're the same "character" but have different personalities, like Manwë. Sometimes the names are different, such as the elf group Teleri not being the same elf group as what the Teleri are in the published version. 

## I. The Tale of Tinúviel
This is our introduction to the pattern Christopher keeps pretty consistent through this book:
1. Tolkien's writing
2. Footnotes
3. Notes on names
4. Christopher's commentary

I'll put some notes about the story here later.
