<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p>I thought it may be helpful to jot down a few notes for people who may never have read any of the <em>History of Middle-Earth</em> series. These notes are specific to these two first volumes, <em>The Book of Lost Tales, Volume 1</em> and <em>Volume 2</em>.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Read <em>The Silmarillion</em> twice.</strong> Seriously. You'll get a lot more out of this book if you know your Manwës from your Melkors.</li>
    <li><strong>This is not a narrative.</strong> It is a history of Tolkien's progress in writing fairy stories that eventually became his published works. His son Christopher approaches this in a fairly detached, scholarly manner.</li>
    <li><strong>This is a narrative.</strong> Christopher interrupts quite frequently but also does a wonderful job at keeping the throughline of the story's frame narrative.</li>
    <li>The story has <strong>a frame narrative totally unfamiliar to readers of <em>The Silmarillion</em></strong>. A man, Eriol or Ælfwine (the name changes), lands on the island of Tol Eressëa, discovers the elves, and learns their history.</li>
    <li><strong>The characters of this book often share names with characters in <em>The Silmarillion</em> but they are <em>not</em> the same character.</strong> Sometimes they're the same &quot;character&quot; but have different personalities, like Manwë (and all the Valar, really). Sometimes the names are different, such as the elf group Teleri not being the same elf group as what the Teleri are in the published version.</li>
