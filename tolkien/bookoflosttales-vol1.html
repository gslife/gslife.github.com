<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p>I thought it may be helpful to jot down a few notes for people who may never have read any of the <em>History of Middle-Earth</em> series. These notes are specific to these two first volumes, <em>The Book of Lost Tales, Volume 1</em> and <em>Volume 2</em>.</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Read <em>The Silmarillion</em> twice.</strong> Seriously. You'll get a lot more out of this book if you know your Manwës from your Melkors.</li>
    <li><strong>This is not a narrative.</strong> It is a history of Tolkien's progress in writing fairy stories that eventually became his published works. His son Christopher approaches this in a fairly detached, scholarly manner.</li>
    <li><strong>This is a narrative.</strong> Christopher interrupts quite frequently but also does a wonderful job at keeping the throughline of the story's frame narrative.</li>
    <li>The story has <strong>a frame narrative totally unfamiliar to readers of <em>The Silmarillion</em>.</strong> A man, Eriol or Ælfwine (the name changes), lands on the island of Tol Eressëa, discovers the elves, and learns their history.</li>
    <li><strong>The characters of this book often share names with characters in <em>The Silmarillion</em> but they are <em>not</em> the same character.</strong> Sometimes they're the same &quot;character&quot; but have different personalities, like Manwë. Sometimes the names are different, such as the elf group Teleri not being the same elf group as what the Teleri are in the published version.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="forward">Forward</h2>
<p>If this is your first time reading this or any of the History series, totally feel free to skip Christopher's forward. He's mainly talking about:</p>
<ol>
    <li>the frame of The Silmarillion and the difference of &quot;depth&quot; between that book and LOTR</li>
    <li>What he feels is a mistake, in that he didn't have Bilbo frame The Silmarillion</li>
    <li>Context around this book (The Book of Lost Tales) that's pretty confusing until you've actually read the book.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're so inclined, just skip right to Chapter 1: The Cottage of Lost Play.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-cottage-of-lost-play">1. The Cottage of Lost Play</h2>
<p>This is our introduction to the pattern Christopher keeps pretty consistent through this book:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Tolkien's writing</li>
    <li>Footnotes</li>
    <li>Notes on names</li>
    <li>Christopher's commentary</li>
</ol>
<p>Eriol comes (somehow) to the Lonely Isle, Tol Eressëa, where he finds the Cottage of Lost Play. The gnomes (aka fairies aka elves) are small, as Eriol has to shrink to fit into their house. These are like elves that hide in flowers, like Keebler elves. Here he is hosted by Lindo and Vairë, who talk about the Cottage of old, where children would come in dreams to fairyland and lose themselves.</p>
<p>Christopher expands on his father's idea of a &quot;mythology for England&quot;, as Tol Eressëa is an ancient version of England and Eriol is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles">the Angles</a>. We can see connections to fairy myth as fairies remain small here, and children are taken by fairies and are lost in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairyland">the realm of the Fay</a>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we get versions of The Cottage of Lost Play as a poem written prior to the previous prose. John and Edith make a cameo appearance here.</p>
